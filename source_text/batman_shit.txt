TWO HOODS run down a tiled corridor in the office section 
     of the complex. They're almost at the end of the hall when 
     a CAPED BLACK SHADOW steps into their path.

     It stands there, motionless. EXTENDS ITS ARMS -- like giant 
     WINGS -- revealing the yellow-and-black insigne on its 
     massive chest. BATMAN.

     One millisecond later, the shocked HOODS are racing back in 
     the opposite direction.

     THE BATMAN flings a handful of STEEL BALL-BEARINGS across 
     the tiled floor. HOOD I tumbles to the floor and lands 
     hard, losing his breath. HOOD II rolls and pulls a GUN.

     BATMAN hurls a BOOMERANG -- its edges scalloped, like a 
     bat's wing. HOOD II finds his gun hand PINNED TO THE WALL 
     by the twin prongs of the BATARANG.

     THE BATMAN strides briskly toward them, businesslike, 
     taking his time. He grabs a handful of HOOD I's hair, lifts 
     his head off the floor, KNEES HIM IN THE FACE.

     He turns to the petrified HOOD II. CHROME-STEEL TALONS 
     spring out of his fingertips. He strolls past HOOD II,
     reaching out casually to give him a QUICK NICK on the chin.

     HOOD II slumps against the wall, unconscious.
