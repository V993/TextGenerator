TWO HOODS run down a tiled corridor in the office section of the complex 
a CAPED BLACK SHADOW steps into their path It stands there, motionless WINGS -- revealing the yellow-and-black insigne on its  massive chest BATMAN 
One millisecond later, the shocked HOODS are racing back in  the opposite direction 
THE BATMAN flings a handful of STEEL BALL-BEARINGS across  the tiled floor hard, losing his breath
TWO HOODS rolls and pulls a GUN 
BATMAN hurls a BOOMERANG -- its edges scalloped, like a  bat's wing by the twin prongs of the BATARANG 
THE BATMAN strides briskly toward them, businesslike,  taking his time his head off the floor, KNEES HIM IN THE FACE He turns to the petrified HOOD II spring out of his fingertips reaching out casually to give him a QUICK NICK on the chin 
HOOD II slumps against the wall, unconscious
