The world changed on September 11, 2001, and since that day, under the strong, steady, and visionary leadership of President George W. Bush, Americans have helped make the world not only safer, but better
The President continues to lead a steady, confident, systematic campaign to defend America against the dangers of our time
We are going after terrorists wherever they plot and plan and hide, changing the old course of pinprick strikes that did little to get at the root of terrorism
We eliminated many of al Qaeda's key leaders and put the world on notice that nations that train, harbor, or finance terrorists are just as guilty as the terrorists themselves
We will not allow the world's most dangerous regimes to possess the world's most dangerous weapons
Our message is getting through, as indicated by Libya's leader, who decided to turn over his weapons of mass destruction and cooperate with the international community
Today, because America has acted, and because America has led, the forces of terror and tyranny have suffered defeat after defeat, and America and the world are safer
On September 11, 2001, we saw the cruelty of the terrorists, and we glimpsed the future they intend for us
They intend to strike the United States to the limits of their power
They seek weapons of mass destruction to kill Americans on an even greater scale
This danger is increased when outlaw regimes build or acquire weapons of mass destruction and maintain ties to terrorist groups
On September 11, 2001, we saw the spirit of courage and optimism of the American people – that greatest assurance of the ultimate triumph of our cause
Courage and optimism led colleagues to help each other in escaping from collapsing buildings
Courage and optimism led policemen, firefighters, emergency medical professionals, public works employees, our men and women in uniform, and selfless volunteers to run into burning buildings to save others and undertake a mammoth rescue and recovery effort
Courage and optimism led the passengers on Flight 93 to rush their murderers to save lives on the ground
Courage and optimism led America's parents and teachers to battle their own fears to keep children calm and safe
In those and countless other acts of heroism on that day, and many times since, terrorists have learned that Americans will not be intimidated
We will fight them with everything we have – and we will prevail
President Bush answered the challenge of September 11, 2001, not only with steadfast resolve, but also with vision, optimism, and unshakable confidence in the will and faith of the American people
That is what we all saw on September 14, 2001, when our President stood with the brave workers at Ground Zero and resolutely assured our nation amidst our shock, anger, and grief that while the terrorists had struck first, America would have the last word
The President's most solemn duty is to protect our country
George W. Bush has kept that charge
To protect our people, President Bush is leading America, staying on the offensive against threats within our own country
He worked with Congress to establish the Department of Homeland Security in the most significant reorganization of the federal government since 1947
The PATRIOT Act is being used to track terrorist activity and to break up terror cells
Now, the FBI can use tools that have been long available to fight organized crime and drug trafficking, but could not be used in the past to fight terrorism
Intelligence and law enforcement officials are sharing information as never before
The President transformed the mission of the FBI to focus first and foremost on preventing terrorism
Every element of America's homeland security plan is critical, because the terrorists are ruthless and resourceful – and we know they are preparing to attack us again
It is not possible to guarantee perfect security in our vast, free nation
But the President and Vice President, along with many fine professionals in intelligence, homeland security, law enforcement, and the military are working tirelessly to protect the country
We are grateful to them all
President Bush recognized that to overcome the dangers of our time, America would have to take a new approach in the world
– and by a renewed commitment to building a hopeful future in hopeless places, instead of allowing troubled regions to remain in despair and explode in violence
Before entering office, President Bush recognized that our age is a time of opportunity for America – opportunity to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, and liberty
That conviction is in the finest traditions of the Republican Party
As our platform said in 1984, during the height of Cold War confrontation: "The supreme purpose of our foreign policy must be to maintain our freedom in a peaceful international environment in which the United States and our allies and friends are secure against military threats, and democratic governments are flourishing in a world of increasing prosperity
The reality of 9/11 does not diminish our generation's opportunity to advance the cause of freedom but in fact makes it all the more important that we take up that challenge
President Bush has rallied America to its calling – to make the world safer and better
This calling is answered by a distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests
Americans everywhere are remaining faithful to that duty
By keeping our word and holding firm to our values, this generation is showing the world the power of liberty once again
