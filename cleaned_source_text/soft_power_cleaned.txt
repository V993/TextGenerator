China’s cultivation of soft power and influence in IOs is arguably deliberate and most certainly a vital component of China’s foreign policy
Understanding these features is key to understanding China’s impact on IOs, as well as any possible ramifications onto the functionalities of these IOs
This paper will focus on two facets of the relationship between China and IOs, namely how China and other states use IOs, and the motivations behind China’s particular foreign policy
There are numerous perspectives on the motivations behind China’s recent increase in soft power and Chinese influence has been widely discussed and theorized
Additionally, China’s actions fit in to a larger idea of how states use formal IOs for their own benefit
IOs facilitate most day-to-day interactions and even dramatic confrontations between states, yet the ultimate reason for the existence or form of IOs remains in debate
This paper will take the rationalist and institutionalist approach use by Abbott and Snidal (1998) to understand the relationship between IOs and member states
Our approach will understand IOs as centralizing mediums through which states are able to achieve their own goals which would otherwise be difficult to realize on a decentralized basis
The power of IOs is thus the development of norms and practices that regulate the international system
An important facet of this understanding highlights the relative autonomy IOs must posses in order to play their role in interstate collaboration
While states are opposed to allowing IOs any autonomy over a particular state, an IOs role in the system still holds sway in how states achieve their goals
This is a focal point of this paper for two reasons
Firstly, it presents an understanding of the relationships between states and IOs which is necessary towards understanding China’s motivations in the international system
But secondly, it highlights the power IOs have over the capacity of states to realize their centralized goals, which in addition to being a peripheral argument in this paper also ties into why China has focused on soft power so heavily over the past few decades
The paper will identify some forms of Chinese soft power in the international stage, but simple identification of these forms is not adequate for the purposes of this paper
Analysis of China’s strategy and motivations is a vital component for understanding China’s impact in IOs, as well as a point of contention in the relevant literature
Kalimuddin and Anderson (2018) infer from the South China Sea disputes as well as cross-strait relations that the underlying goal of Chinese use of soft power is threefold
Namely, China’s central goals are to control the terms of discussion, make China a preferred partner, and prevent foreign interference
Kalimuddin and Anderson argue that soft power is a major focal point of China’s security strategy and that in order to achieve its goals, China has strayed away from hard power in order to avoid direct questioning
This is an assertion shared by Blanchard and Lu (2012), who also describe a framework for analyzing use of soft power, as well as common mistakes made by analysts in their conceptions of China’s use of it
Blanchard and Lu describe that understanding soft power requires proper contextualization, schema for understanding multiple uses of soft power as an aggregate rather than a sum of parts, and consideration of key intervening variables
This paper will utilize specific case studies to this effect, using Blanchard and Lu as a framework to understand China’s soft power
